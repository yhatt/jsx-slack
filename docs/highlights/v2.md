Welcome to jsx-slack v2! We will introduce shiny new features in v2! :sparkles:

## Migration from v1

Don't be scared! **The basic usage of jsx-slack is exactly same as v1.** Almost user of jsx-slack don't need to change the code written in v1 and can bump to v2 straightly. :sunglasses:

Only `<CheckboxGroup>` and `<Checkbox>` have a breaking change may have the impact to initial options. See details in "**[Breaking change](#breaking-change)**" section if you have using them.

## Highlights

The traditional usage of jsx-slack was wrapping JSX in `JSXSlack()` function.

Since v1.5.0, some components have not been required to wrap by made serializable to JSON directly. And v2 will take this concept a step further!

### JSX returns the real JSON

The core API for JSX has updated, _to return the real JSON object for Slack API from all built-in components._

It means always no need to wrap JSX in `JSXSlack()`! Just writing JSX would work.

```jsx
console.log(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>
      Welcome to <b>jsx-slack v2</b>!
    </Section>
  </Blocks>
)
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
[{
  type: 'section',
  text: {
    type: 'mrkdwn',
    text: 'Welcome to *jsx-slack v2*!',
    verbatim: true
  }
}]
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

`JSXSlack()` is still provided but there is no operataions. Just return the passed value.

#### Create partial JSON

Fully renewed built-in components will be useful to build a partial JSON too.

v1 components might return an invalid object with Slack API by including internal fields for jsx-slack, but v2 will always create the valid partial JSON.

```jsx
console.log(
  <Mrkdwn>
    Welcome to <b>jsx-slack v2</b>!
  </Mrkdwn>
)
```

```javascript
{ type: 'mrkdwn', text: 'Welcome to *jsx-slack v2*!' }
```

#### Tips for TypeScript

When you are using TypeScript, the returned type from JSX would not match to Slack Node SDK so **require to cast JSX into the suitable type**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>TypeScript needs to cast</Section>
  </Blocks>
) as any
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

`JSXSlack()` has become just a type helper to cast JSX into `any` type. _We recommend for TS developer to wrap JSX in `JSXSlack()` as same as jsx-slack v1._

```typescript
// TS user should use the compatible syntax with jsx-slack v1
JSXSlack(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>TypeScript needs to cast</Section>
  </Blocks>
)
```

### React-compatible API

We've organized JSX features and added some public API compatible with React.

- `JSXSlack.createElement()` (means as same as `JSXSlack.h()`)
- `JSXSlack.isValidElement()`
- `JSXSlack.Children`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.map()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.forEach()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.count()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.only()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.toArray()`

### Improved JSDoc

Slack Block Kit has continuously evolved. jsx-slack is working harder to catch up on the latest release of Slack API.

On the other hand, the documentation of jsx-slack has bloated compared to the first version. jsx-slack aims to the alternative interface for building Slack Block Kit easily, but developer would not want dizzy eyes by switching between the code and jsx-slack documentation.

jsx-slack v2 has included JSDoc to many public APIs. While using jsx-slack through JSX transpiler, developer can peek a useful instant help without leaving IDE.

![Improved JSDoc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3993388/77865574-07babd80-726a-11ea-85fd-306fe1da4f0a.png)

### `<Option selected>` and `<RadioButton checked>`

jsx-slack makes a better experience for building Block Kit JSON, with the familiar HTML style. v2 added support for (HTML-compatible) `<Option selected>` and `<RadioButton checked>`.

```jsx
<Blocks>
  <section>
    <p>Select options:</p>
    <select multiple name="options">
      <option selected>Option A</option>
      <option selected>Option B</option>
      <option>Option C</option>
    </select>
  </section>
</Blocks>
```

It makes a better developer experience in setting the initial state of the static select and the radio button group.

`<Select value="...">` and `<RadioButtonGroup value="...">`, the classic way to set initial selected / checked option(s), will still work. Please notice that _`selected` and `checked` will be ignored_ when setting `value` prop in the parent component.

```jsx
<Blocks>
  <section>
    <b>NOTE: Prefer the parent `value` prop to `selected` state.</b>
    <select multiple name="options" value="c">
      <option value="a" selected>
        Option A
      </option>
      <option value="b" selected>
        Option B
      </option>
      <option value="c">Option C (Actually selected)</option>
    </select>
  </section>
</Blocks>
```

> :warning: To make consistency in the whole of jsx-slack, v2 has a breaking change for the behavior of `<CheckboxGroup values={[...]}>` and `<Checkbox checked>` (They already have provided since v1). See details in "[Breaking change](#breaking-change)".

### More useful error message

jsx-slack will throw an error when there is invalid JSX structure, but the error message in v1 is not so useful to know where is the cause.

```jsx
// v1 throws "<Actions> block has an incompatible element as children.", but which element is?
<Blocks>
  <Actions>
    <ConversationsSelect name="conversations" multiple />
    <Button name="send" style="primary">
      Send
    </Button>
    <Button name="cancel" style="danger">
      Cancel
    </Button>
  </Actions>
</Blocks>
```

v2 has improved a lot of error messages, to display the specific reason of error and a name of built-in component which was triggered an error as possible.

In the above case, v2 throws the error with more useful message: `<Actions> cannot include the element for selection from multiple options: <ConversationsSelect multiple>`

### The other notable updates

- `value` prop for `<Option>` has made optional. jsx-slack will generate `value` text from the content for display if `value` was not defined.
- `confirm` prop for interactive block elements can pass the raw confirm composition object, and all of props for `<Confirm>` have made optional.
- `<a>` tag now renders short syntax for hyperlink if possible.

## Breaking change

### `<CheckboxGroup values={[...]}>` and `<Checkbox checked>`

v1 had merged initially checked options defined by _both of `<Checkbox checked>` and `<CheckboxGroup values>`_.

```jsx
// In jsx-slack v1, B and C will set as initial options.
<Home>
  <Actions>
    <CheckboxGroup values={['b']}>
      <Checkbox value="a">A</Checkbox>
      <Checkbox value="b">B</Checkbox>
      <Checkbox value="c" checked>
        C
      </Checkbox>
    </CheckboxGroup>
  </Actions>
</Home>
```

However, this behavior may not set correct initial states when setting initial values from Slack callback through `values` prop of `<CheckboxGroup>` due to `<Checkbox checked>`.

jsx-slack v2 will **always adopt either of them, and prefer `<CheckboxGroup values>` to `<Checkbox checked>`**. The state defined in `checked` prop of `<Checkbox>` would be adopted only when not defined `values` prop in the parent `<CheckboxGroup>`.

In the above case, _will be ignored the `checked` state of C, and initially checked options become only B._

### Changes for TypeScript

- Now requires TypeScript >= 3.7, due to using [recursive type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#more-recursive-type-aliases) in JSX.
- Exported type `JSXSlack.Child` and `JSXSlack.Children` in v1 have been renamed into `JSXSlack.ChildElement` and `JSXSlack.ChildElements` to avoid conflict with added React-compatible API. In addition, meaningless generics defined in them were removed. The current version of TS cannot narrow the type of JSX children even if allowed props were specified to generics.

## Deprecated

- `jsxslack.raw` has already deprecated because the new JSX structure let it become no need to use. Just rename `jsxslack.raw` into `jsxslack` to fix.
